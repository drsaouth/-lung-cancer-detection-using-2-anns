Lung Cancer Detection Using Two ANNs  This code implements lung cancer detection using two artificial neural networks (ANNs). One ANN extracts features, while the second ANN classifies the results as benign or malignant. It processes medical data, applies deep learning techniques, and improves accuracy for early diagnosis.
